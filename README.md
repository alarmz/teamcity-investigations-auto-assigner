# TeamCity Investigations Auto-Assigner

## General Info
* Vendor: JetBrains
* License: [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
* Plugin type: free, open-source

## Plugin Description
The plugin adds a [build feature](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCDL/Adding+Build+Features) which enables automatic assignment of investigations for a build failure. Investigations are assigned on the basis of the following heuristics:

* If a user is the only committer to the build, the user is responsible.
* If a user is the only one who changed the files, whose names appear in the test or build problem error text, the user is responsible.
* If a user was responsible for this problem previous time, the user is responsible.
* If a user is set as the default responsible user, the user is responsible.

## Status
Working prototype is implemented.

## TeamCity Versions Compatibility
Compatible with TeamCity 2017.2 and later.
